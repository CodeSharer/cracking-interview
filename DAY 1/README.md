## DAY 1. Arrays and Strings

List of tasks:
- [Is Unique](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%201/IsUnique.java)  
  *Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?*

- [Check permutation](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%201/CheckPermutation.java)  
  *Given two string, write a method to decide if one is permutation of the other.*

- [URLify](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%201/Urlify.java)  
  *Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place).  
  __EXAMPLE:__  
  Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13  
  Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"*

- [Palindrome permutation](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%201/PalindromePermutation.java)  
  *Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.  
  __EXAMPLE:__  
  Input: "Tact Coa"  
  Output: true (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)*

- [One Away](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%201/OneAway.java)  
  *There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.  
  __EXAMPLE:__  
  "pale", "ple" -> true  
  "pales", "pale" -> true  
  "pale", "bale" -> true  
  "pale", "bake" -> false*
